### Assignment \ Quiz \ Exam Policy: 
Students are responsible for keeping up with due dates.  Specific dates are given in the Dropbox section of Pilot.  
All labs must be submitted via the Dropbox on Pilot. Be sure you upload the files and then click submit. If you do not receive an email  
confirmation, then your work was not properly submitted. Be sure to allow enough time to submit your work before the Dropbox closes.  
Personal computer issues/loss of data/not allowing enough upload time are not valid justifications to merit an extension of the deadline.  
Quizzes and Exams will be given in an online format.  Dates for both will be announced with ample time.  If the student requires any  
change / extension they are responsible for notifying the instructor as soon as possible.
### Late Policy: 
Late work will receive a penalty of 10% off per day.  Work more than 3 days late will not be accepted.  
Exams and quizzes will only be open for the time frame specified.
### Students with disabilities: 
Any student with a disability must register with the Office of Disability Services to determine what accommodations, if any, are appropriate.  
The student must inform the instructor of the special accommodations needed as soon as possible. 
### Technology Requirements: 
This course requires you to have access to a computer and the internet.  If you do not own or have access to any of these items, please see the  
“Remote Support Information” options through CaTS and contact them for assistance here: wright.edu/it. In the event CaTS does not have support  
options, please contact the instructor via email as soon as possible.  
### Help Room: 
The Department of Computer Science and Engineering maintains a help room, staffed by upper-level students, for students in introductory  
programming classes.  
A virtual help room is available via the Department’s Discord server.  In the “WSU Computer Science Department” Discord server, select the  
“CS Help Room” channel.  Here you can make a post to “cs-help-room" to list your questions or request one-on-one support with voice or  
screen sharing.
### Tutoring Services & Study Coaches:
Tutoring Services provides individual and small group academic support for a wide range of courses. Students can meet with an individual  
tutor by appointment for frequently requested courses numbered 3000 and below.  
Students who want to develop strategies and skills specific to their needs for all of their courses can meet by appointment with a Study  
Coach. Study Coaching is an excellent way to get personalized solutions to the challenges of online and in-person courses.  
For students to sign up for appointments, follow the link on the website (www.wright.edu/tutoring) to the Tutoring Services Online Request  
form. Once the form is received, their front desk staff will be in contact regarding their appointment status. Appointments are free and  
are set for one hour each week through the last week of classes.
### Academic misconduct: 
Labs are to be completed individually. Sharing your work or copying someone else's work will result in a 0 for the assignment(s) and a  
formal Academic Integrity Violation will be submitted. The university policy on academic misconduct can be found at http://www.wright.edu/students/judicial/integrity.html

## Lecture Topics:
